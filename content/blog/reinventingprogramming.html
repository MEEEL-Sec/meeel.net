<h2>Reinventing Myself As A Programmer</h2>
July 14th 2022<br><br>
I've been studying security for a few years now, but I've never really done a deep dive into programming, I know how to read code and I understand basic programming concepts, but I've always felt a little hands-off and alienated without that concrete experience, so I'm going to learn some programming, for real this time.<br><br>
I had started really developing an interest in programming at the age of 11, I didn't even have my own computer at that point and use of the family laptop wasn't convenient, it was always in use, so I started coding with nothing but an Android phone and a few coding apps. By the time I was 13 I had gathered enough money to make a real investment into a gaming PC, prebuilt, standard run of the mill gaming PC, and it was great, more than I would have ever needed. This PC brought with it a whole new world of possibility. I could start writing scripts to control the mouse and automate tasks, I used Ruby the most during this time.<br><br>
Exploit development has always been my dream tech job, If you were to ask me where I want to be 10 years from now, I'm going to tell you exploit development. Writing elegant exploits that fly undetected utilizing complex assembly tricks is just so intriguing to me, there's nothing in this world I want to do more than that, and I'm going to need to get a good hold of systems programming if I ever want to make that dream a reality.<br><br>
So I started learning C and assembly architectures, exploit development really is a dark art that isn't covered in many places, it's a true wild west where freedom reigns in every little thing you do, there are near infinite ways to write an exploit and everyone has their own methods.<br><br>
The problem is that exploit development takes a lot of time and energy to learn, at the end of the day, I still need to be able to pay bills and I do not currently have a job at the time of writing. Another problem that arises is that exploit development positions require a large amount of experience to even be considered for the position, better off landing a penetration testing position and pivoting from there.

<h2>I Love Hacking</h2>
July 16th 2022<br><br>
I really mean it, I <b>love</b> hacking, I can't see myself doing anything other than participating in the ever-evolving game of cat and mouse. There's just something so satisfying about tricking computers into doing exactly what you want them to do. There's a serious craving for knowledge that just never seems to stop, my favorite thing to do with my off time is to learn new tricks.<br><br>
Okay, I misused the definition of hacking, sure. I'm going by the holywood definition because everytime I say I get paid to hack things that's just immediately when everyone thinks about, maybe it's better to call myself a security analyst infront of people who don't work in tech. It's not even the payment that drives me at this point, there's just something so fun about breaking into systems (that I own or am authorized to break into) just for the sake of seeing if it's possible.<br><br>
A lot of my time these days is spent automating and extending my arsenal of personal security tools, I love gluing tools together in a perl script and merging them together into a really powerful ecosystem that gets stuff done. What's even more fun is making a cronjob to run those scripts 24/7 automating my recon and making my life eaier, it's incredibly satisyfing to make your own life easier by putting in hard work.<br><br> 
I really do hope I get to do this for the rest of my life, the end goal being exploit development of course, but this game of cat and mouse you get to play with a penetration testing role does not seem like it will ever get old.

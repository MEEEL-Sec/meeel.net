<h2>Dotfiles</h2>
In the "altOS" world people seem to love showing off their unique and fully custom machines that you otherwise wouldn't be able to get if you were using an operating system such as Windows or MacOS, I like that, but that also means you can make your machine as minimalist as you want without ANY bells or whistles.<br><br>
I strive for minimalism and really have nothing to show off, I don't even have a bar to tell me what time it is, because I can simply type type <b>date</b> into the terminal. My machine looks exactly like this website.<br><br>

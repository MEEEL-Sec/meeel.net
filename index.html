I am meeel, welcome to my website. I am a cyber-security researcher from Appalachia and I'm constantly learning new things.<br><br>
This site is only comprised of html+css. I write everything from scratch in vim. There are zero trackers on this site, not even a single tracker for analytics, I am not interested in the slightest about where you're from or how many people may be reading this site, I just write about what I've learned, what I think others may find useful, and some of my opinions.<br><br>
Enjoy your stay.
